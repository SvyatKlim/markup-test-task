      <p class="subtitle">Helix’s Exome+® assay has been carefully optimized to provide the benefits of lcWGS,
        whole exome sequencing, microarrays, and targeted panels — all in one assay.</p>

                  provide high quality coverage
                  of specific, pre-defined genomic regions of interest. While useful in certain settings, such assays

                  With ≥ 99.5% call rate across ~600 genes relevant
                  to many disease states, the Exome+ assay enables you to run multiple panel-grade analyses with a
